If you have ever *wondered* how **search** works, 
its all about *finding* ***patterns***. <br />
While a *search engine* will have sophisticated 
[search algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm) at their
*core* are searches for patterns in text.

## Summary

A regular expression is a pattern we search for in text.

Imagine you want to check if an email address is well correct when someone
is filling in a form.
One way of doing this would be to try *sending* an email to the address and
waiting for a reply or "[bounce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_message)" 
(error)...
(*obviously* this is a *terrible* idea! sending email is time consuming)
A far more efficient way of checking email validity is to use a regular
expression that will tell us in a milisecond 
if the email matches a valid pattern.
